#### Project Objective
The Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, the owner of the Vrinda store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

## Data Cleaning 
- Fix spelling Mistakes in Gender Column:Use the find and replace method to correct spelling mistakes and variations in the 'Gender' column. Create a mapping dictionary to standardize gender values (e.g., 'to'male', 'female' to 'Female', 'f' to 'Female').Clean Duplicates in order_id:

- Remove duplicate rows based on the 'order_id' column to ensure uniqueness.
- Create Age Bracket Column: Used the if function to categorize ages into brackets. For example, create an 'Age Bracket' column with labels like 'Teenage' for ages till 29, 'Adult' for ages 30 to 49, and 'Senior' for ages 50 and above.
Create Month Column from Date:
- Extract the month from the 'Date' column and create a new column, 'Month', to represent the month in a readable format (e.g., 'January', 'February', etc.).
