#### Project Objective
The Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, the owner of the Vrinda store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

## Data Cleaning 
- Fix spelling Mistakes in Gender Column:Use the find and replace method to correct spelling mistakes and variations in the 'Gender' column. Create a mapping dictionary to standardize gender values (e.g., 'to'male', 'female' to 'Female', 'f' to 'Female').Clean Duplicates in order_id:

- Remove duplicate rows based on the 'order_id' column to ensure uniqueness.
- Create Age Bracket Column: Used the if function to categorize ages into brackets. For example, create an 'Age Bracket' column with labels like 'Teenage' for ages till 29, 'Adult' for ages 30 to 49, and 'Senior' for ages 50 and above.
Create Month Column from Date:
- Extract the month from the 'Date' column and create a new column, 'Month', to represent the month in a readable format (e.g., 'January', 'February', etc.).

- Pivot Table Creation:Generated a pivot table that aggregates sales data by month, calculating both the total sales amount and the count of orders for each month. This provides a concise summary of sales performance over time.
- Combo Chart Visualization: Utilized a combo chart to visually represent the sales data. The chart comprises columns to depict the sales amount and a trend line to illustrate the quantity of products sold for each corresponding month.
- Key Observations: Identified March as the most successful month based on the visual representation.Noted a substantial sales amount of over 19 lakh and a high quantity of products sold, with approximately 2800 items in that particular month.

- Analysis of Purchases by Gender:Conducted an examination to determine the purchasing behavior based on gender.
- Pivot Table Creation: Developed a pivot table with 'Gender' as one axis and the 'Amount' column to quantify the purchase amounts made by both men and women.
- Pie Chart Visualization: Utilized a pie chart to visually represent the distribution of purchases between men and women. The chart segments were based on the aggregated purchase amounts.
- Key Findings: Discovered that women make a substantial contribution to the overall purchases, constituting a significant share of 64%.Men, while still making notable purchases, represented a slightly smaller share at 35%.
> In summary, the analysis and visual representation, through the pivot table and pie chart, revealed that women contribute more significantly to the total purchase amounts compared to men, holding a majority share in the observed data.

-Order Status Analysis: Examined the distribution of orders based on different order statuses, which include 'Return,' 'Refunded,' 'Delivered,' and 'Cancelled.'
- Pie Chart Visualization: Created a pie chart to visually represent the share of each order status category. Each slice of the pie corresponds to one of the order status categories.
- Key Observations: Noted that the 'Delivered' status dominates the order distribution, contributing a substantial 92% share.The remaining 8% is distributed among other order statuses, including 'Return,' 'Refunded,' and 'Cancelled.'
> In conclusion, the pie chart provides a clear overview of the order status distribution, emphasizing that the majority of orders are successfully delivered. The visualization highlights the relative proportions of each order status category, with 'Delivered' standing out as the predominant status.

- Objective: Explored the distribution of sales across various age groups based on gender, with a focus on understanding the sales contribution of women compared to men.
- Pivot Table Creation: Developed a pivot table to aggregate sales data by gender and age groups, facilitating a detailed analysis of sales distribution.
- Column Chart Visualization: Utilized a column chart to visually represent the percentage share of sales for each gender within different age groups. Notably, the chart highlights the higher contribution of women compared to men.
- Key Insights: The column chart underscores that women make a substantial contribution to the overall sales, surpassing the contribution from men.Approximately 50% of the total sales share is attributed to the adult age group, with the remaining sales distributed among the teenager and senior age groups.
> In conclusion, the visual representation reveals that women play a significant role in contributing to sales, and the majority of sales are concentrated in the adult age group. This analysis provides valuable insights into the gender-wise and age-wise dynamics of sales distribution.
